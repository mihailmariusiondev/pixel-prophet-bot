You are tasked with adding error handling to a piece of code to improve its robustness and reliability. The code will be provided to you, and you should analyze it to add appropriate error handling mechanisms.

To add error handling to this code, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the code to understand its structure and functionality.
2. Identify potential points of failure, such as:
   - External API calls
   - File operations
   - Database queries
   - User input processing
   - Resource-intensive operations

3. Add error handling mechanisms that:
   - Catch and handle specific exceptions
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Implement appropriate recovery or fallback strategies
   - Log errors for debugging and monitoring

When adding error handling, follow these guidelines:

- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using bare except clauses
- Provide informative error messages that help diagnose the issue
- Consider using custom exceptions for application-specific errors
- Implement appropriate error recovery strategies (e.g., retries, fallbacks)
- Ensure resources are properly released in case of errors (e.g., use finally blocks)
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Avoid suppressing errors silently; always log or re-raise exceptions

Your output should be the original code with your added error handling mechanisms. Make sure to preserve the original code's formatting and structure.

Remember, the goal is to make the code more robust and reliable without changing its core functionality. Your error handling should gracefully manage potential issues and provide useful information for troubleshooting.
