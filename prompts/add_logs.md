You are tasked with adding logging statements to a piece of code to improve its observability and debugging capabilities. The code will be provided to you, and you should analyze it to add appropriate logging statements.

To add logging statements to this code, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the code to understand its structure and functionality.
2. Identify key points where logging would be beneficial, such as:
   - Function entry and exit points
   - Important decision points (e.g., if/else blocks)
   - Before and after critical operations
   - Error conditions and exceptions

3. Add logging statements that capture:
   - The flow of execution
   - Important variable values
   - Error messages and stack traces
   - Performance metrics (if applicable)

When adding logging statements, follow these guidelines:

- Use appropriate logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Include relevant context in log messages (e.g., function name, important variables)
- Use string formatting to include variable values in log messages
- Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys)
- Use consistent formatting and style across all log messages
- Consider adding log correlation IDs for tracking requests across multiple components

Your output should be the original code with your added logging statements. Make sure to preserve the original code's formatting and structure.

Remember, the goal is to improve the code's observability without significantly impacting its performance. Your logging statements should provide valuable information for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
